## Motivation
- Created to explore phase transitions in physical systems.
- Generated by a research group at XYZ University as part of a statistical physics study.

## Composition
- Instances: 10,000 configurations of a 2D Ising model.
- Features: Spin states, temperature, energy.
- Missing Data: None.

## Collection Process
- Simulations generated using a Monte Carlo algorithm over varying temperatures.

## Preprocessing
- Normalization of input features.
- Data split into train, validate, and test sets (70-20-10).

## Uses
- Predicting phase transitions in other spin models.
- Not suitable for non-spin systems without further validation.
